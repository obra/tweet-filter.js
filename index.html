        <h1>Spyhunter removes #spymaster tweets from your twitterstream</h1>
        <p>#spymaster got you down? Don't fret. spyhunter is here to remove tweets containing the hashtag #spymaster from your twitter stream.  It's a quick hack of a GreaseKit plugin.</p>
        <p>I owe a debt to <a href="http://web.me.com/t_trace/pbtweet.html">pbtweet</a>, which served as a template for this quick hack of a script.</p>
        <p>To install spyhunter, just <a href="/~jesse/spyhunter/spyhunter.user.js">install this GreaseKit script</a>. Who knows. It might even work with Greasemonkey.
